# DSC650_Summer_2020_ConvNets_model_with_CIFAR-10_dataset
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets/CNNs). These are neural networks that are suited for a variety of image recognition tasks including image classification and object detection. Build a ConvNet from labeled image data to perform multiple category image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset. Understand how to use existing models to classify images. Describe how to fine-tune existing models for specific classification tasks.
