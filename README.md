# DSC650_Summer_2020_ConvNets_model_with_CIFAR-10_dataset
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets/CNNs). These are neural networks that are suited for a variety of image recognition tasks including image classification and object detection. Build a ConvNet from labeled image data to perform multiple category image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset. Understand how to use existing models to classify images. Describe how to fine-tune existing models for specific classification tasks.

A. Using section 5.2 in Deep Learning with Python as a guide, create a ConvNet model that classifies images CIFAR10 small images classification dataset(https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar10/). Do not use dropout or data-augmentation in this part. Save the model, predictions, metrics, and validation plots.

B. Using section 5.2 in Deep Learning with Python as a guide, create a ConvNet model that classifies images CIFAR10 small images classification dataset(https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar10/). This time includes dropout and data-augmentation. Save the model, predictions, metrics, and validation plots.

The models for both A and B are saved in the HDF format. The validation plots will display the accuaracy & loss for each ConvNet models based on their training and validataion.
